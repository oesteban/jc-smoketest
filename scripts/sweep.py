"""Daily sweep: expire overdue claims, send reminders, recompute aggregates.

Mirrors the website repo's scheduled-Action pattern (checkout → run → commit-back).
Idempotent: it reads absolute timestamps, not "what changed since yesterday", so a
skipped day self-heals on the next run. Per-paper ``reminded`` markers guarantee
each nudge fires once.

Writes ``notifications.json`` (git-ignored) — a list of {issue, body} the workflow
posts as issue comments (GitHub then emails the @-mentioned assignee). No SMTP.
