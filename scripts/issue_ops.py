"""Issue-ops dispatcher — the single entrypoint ``issue-ops.yml`` runs.

Parses a GitHub ``issues`` (claim form) or ``issue_comment`` (`/claim` `/withdraw`
`/submit` `/extend`) event, validates + applies it against freshly-loaded state,
and writes:

* the updated ``claims/<issue>.json`` + regenerated ``data/status.json``;
* ``comment.md``   — the reply body the workflow posts (GitHub then emails the author);
* ``actions.json`` — {issue, add_labels, assignees} the workflow applies via ``gh``.

No network calls here, so ``handle_event`` is unit-testable with a plain dict.
Identity: only the issue author (or an organizer) may drive a claim thread.
